    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>The most used format for submitting and publishing papers in the academic domain is the Portable Document Format (PDF),
      since its possibility of being rendered in the same way independently from the device used for visualising it. However,
      the PDF format has some important issues as well, among which the lack of interactivity and the low degree of accessibility.
      In order to address these issues, recently some journals, conferences, and workshops have started to accept also HTML
      as Web-first submission/publication format. However, most of the people are not able to produce a well-formed HTML5
      article from scratch, and they would, thus, need an appropriate interface, e.g. a word processor, for creating such
      HTML-compliant scholarly article. </p>
    <p>To provide a solution to the aforementioned issue, in this paper we introduce the RASH JavaScript Editor (a.k.a. RAJE),
      which is a multi platform word processor for writing scholarly article in HTML natively. RAJE allows authors to write
      research papers by means of a user-friendly interface hiding the complexities of HTML5. We also discuss the outcome
      of a user study where we asked some researchers to write a scientific paper using RAJE.</p>
    <p><strong>RASH version: </strong><a href="https://rawgit.com/gspinaci/raje-doceng2017/master/raje-doceng2017.html">https://w3id.org/people/essepuntato/papers/raje-doceng2017.html</a></p>
  </section>
  <section id="section1">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Currently, the most used format for submitting and publishing scholarly articles is the Portable Document Format (PDF)
      <a href="#bib12"> </a>. One of the main strengths of this format is its hard formatting style that ensures to be read
      and visualised by any device in the same way. However, PDF has also important drawbacks, such as the lack of interactivity,
      the fact that its monolithic structure is not appropriate for sharing its content on the Web as a common web page,
      and its known difficulties regarding the accessibility of its content by people with disabilities <a href="#bib13"> </a>.
      Usually, in order to submit an article to a particular venue such as a journal or a conference, authors need to create
      a document that will be exported as PDF. This document is usually written with word processors (e.g. Microsoft Word
      and OpenOffice) or by means of appropriate markup languages such as LaTeX. While in the first case the rendering of
      the document (and, thus, of the final PDF to export) is what the word processor shows in the screen, LaTeX obliges
      its users to compile the document in order to understand how it will be rendered in PDF.</p>
    <p>In the last years, the use of PDF as submission/publication format has been criticised by several people and movements
      (e.g. <a href="https://linkedresearch.org/">Linked Research</a>), and several discussions have raised the issue of
      using another (Web-first, accessible, and open) format for preparing and sharing scholarly works, i.e. HTML <a href="#bib6"> </a>.
      Following this idea, several conferences and journals have started to experiment the use of HTML as submission format.
      For instance the <a href="http://iswc2016.semanticweb.org/">15th</a> and the <a href="http://iswc2016.semanticweb.org/">16th International Semantic Web Conference</a>,
      the <a href="2016.eswc-conferences.org">13th</a> and the <a href="2016.eswc-conferences.org">14th Extended Semantic Web Conference</a>,
      the <a href="http://ekaw2016.cs.unibo.it">20th International Conference on Knowledge Management and Knowledge Engineering</a>,
      the Poster and Demo session at <a href="https://2017.semantics.cc">13th International Conference on Semantic Systems</a>,
      and journals like <a href="http://datasciencehub.net/">Data Science</a> published by IOS Press, are among those that
      have started to adopt HTML.</p>
    <p>One of the <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/#venues-that-have-adopted-rash-as-submission-format">most used and appreciated formats</a>      for creating HTML-based scholarly papers is the <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash">Research Articles in Simplified HTML (RASH)</a>      <a href="#bib1"> </a>. RASH is a markup language that restricts the use of HTML elements to only 32 elements and enables
      one to include also RDF statements <a href="#bib15"> </a>. In addition, it uses the new Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA
      Module 1.0 <a href="#bib14"> </a> for specifying accessible structural semantics to the various document parts. While
      the framework that has been developed for RASH includes a lot of conversion tools from word processor formats (e.g.
      the Open Document Format used by Open Office and the Open XML format used by Microsoft Word), no native editor for
      facilitating the creation of Web-first RASH article has been proposed yet.</p>
    <p>In this paper, we introduce the <strong>RASH JavaScript Editor</strong> (RAJE), a <em>What You See Is What You Get</em>      (WYSIWYG) word processor for writing scholarly articles in HTML, according to the RASH format. In particular, RAJE
      allows authors to write research papers in HTML natively by means of a user-friendly interface, instead of writing
      raw markup with an IDE, a text editor or any external word processor. RAJE guarantees to its users the benefits of
      a word processor combined with the ones given by an HTML-based format, i.e. interactiveness, accessibility and easiness
      to be processed by machines. In addition, RAJE uses the GitHub API so as to allow authors to store their articles online,
      to keep track of changes by means of the GitHub services, and to share the articles with others. This paper has been
      written by using RAJE itself, and it was converted into the appropriate layout requested by the conference by means
      of the <a href="http://dasplab.cs.unibo.it/rocs">RASH Online Conversion Service (ROCS)</a> <a href="#bib16"></a>.</p>
    <p>The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In <a href="#section2"> </a> we describe some of the most important HTML-based
      editors, while in <a href="#background"></a> we give some background about RASH and the existing tools in the RASH
      framework. In <a href="#section3"></a> we introduce RAJE, and we provide a high-level description and show some details
      about its implementation. In <a href="#section4"></a> we present the outcomes of a user testing session we have run
      by involving people in the Academia so as to understand the level of perceived usability of RAJE when used for writing
      a scholarly article. Finally, in <a href="#section9"></a> we conclude the paper sketching out some future developments.</p>

    <h1>Related works</h1>
    <p>In the past several works have been developed for easing the creation of HTML-based scholarly papers. In this section,
      we introduce some of the most relevant ones, by discussing their main characteristics.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.authorea.com/">Authorea</a></strong> is an online platform to write and edit scientific
      papers. Every article is an HTML document and Git repository simultaneously. The main goal for the development of Authorea
      was to <a href="http://www.astrobetter.com/blog/2015/07/13/why-should-i-use-authorea-to-write-my-papers/">fix collaborative problems that could come out during the creation of technical, scholarly and scientific writings</a>,
      so as to allow authors to take advantages of using Git versioning system and keeping track of every single displayed
      change. In addition, every article is accessible from anywhere, by using any device connected to the Internet, and
      no TeX installation is required for producing the final PDF layout necessary for the submission. In addition, Authorea
      allows one to write <a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/3/articles/6055-how-is-authorea-different-from-google-docs/">mathematical notations, tables, plots and figures in each LaTeX and MathML</a>.</p>
    <p>​​<strong><a href="http://dokie.li/">Dokieli</a></strong> <a href="#bib17"> </a> is a client-side editor for decentralised
      article publishing, annotations, and social interactions. Since Dokieli follows a pure decentralisation principle,
      authors can publish the paper where they prefer. In particular, Dokieli complies with the <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid protocol</a>,
      based on the Linked Data Platform W3C standard <a href="#bib18"> </a> <a href="#bib19"> </a>, so as to allows one to
      edit the HTML-based scholarly article in the browser and to save it directly to server storage.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.fiduswriter.org/">Fidus Writer</a></strong> is an open source WYSIWYG collaborative HTML-based
      word processor made for academics who need to use citations and formulas within papers. All the articles created with
      it can be exported in more ways: as a website, a paper, or an ebook. Independently from the particular export, the
      editor allows authors to focus on the content of the paper, while the final layout can be choosen once the content
      is finalised. FidusWriter supports LaTeX for adding footnotes and citations directly inside the documents and allows
      a real-time collaboration with other users.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.tinymce.com/">TinyMCE</a></strong> is a WYSIWYG HTML-based editor that can be instantiated
      within an existing HTML page. It is a huge project that involves more than 150 contributors with almost 6500 commits
      on <a href="https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce">Github</a>. Its include facilities for formatting, table insertion,
      image editing, customizable themes, and it is accessible for users with disabilities – in fact, it follows WAI-ARIA
      guidelines <a href="#bib20"> </a> so as to make HTML documents compatible with screen readers such as JAWS and NVDA.
      It is already integrated with frameworks such as JQuery and Angular.js, or inside common content management systems
      such as Wordpress or Joomla.</p>

  <section id="background">
    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>In order to understand some design choices of RAJE, as well as some elements of the interface, we need to provide some
      background about RASH, the language on top of which the editor has been built. </p>
    <section id="background-rash">
      <h1>RASH: Research Articles in Simplified HTML</h1>
      <p>The RASH format is a markup language that restricts the use of HTML elements to only 32 elements for writing academic
        research articles. It allows authors to add RDF statements <a href="#bib15"> </a> to the document by means of the
        element <code>script</code> with the attribute type set to <q>application/rdf+xml</q>, <q>text/turtle</q> or to <q>application/ld+json</q>.
        In addition, RASH strictly follows the Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0 <a href="#bib14"> </a> for expressing
        structural semantics on various markup elements used. </p>
      <p>A RASH document begins as a simple (X)HTML5 document, by specifying the generic HTML DOCTYPE followed by the document
        element <code>html</code> with the usual namespace <q>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</q> specified. The element <code>html</code> contains
        the element <code>head</code> for defining metadata of the document according to the DCTERMS and PRISM standards,
        and the element <code>body</code> for including the whole content of the document. On the one hand, the element <code>head</code> of
        a RASH document must/should include some information about the paper, i.e., the paper title (element <code>title</code>),
        at least one author and other related information (i.e., affiliations, keywords, categories, by using the elements <code>meta</code> and <code>link</code>).
        On the other hand, the element <code>body</code> mainly contains textual elements (e.g., paragraphs, emphases, links,
        and quotations) for describing the content of the paper, and other structural elements (e.g., abstract, sections,
        references, and footnotes) used to organised the paper in appropriate blocks and to present specific complex structures
        (e.g., figures, formulas, and tables).</p>
      <p>Note that RASH is one of the proposals for using HTML-based language in scientific articles. Several others exist and
        are valid. The discussion about RASH and its competitors is out of the scope of this work. More details can be found
        in <a href="#bib1"> </a>, in which we also discussed how the internal structure of RASH takes benefits for implementing
        services and functionalities for the final users.</p>
      <p>
        In particular, it is worth stressing here on the usage of patterns within RASH, that heavily impacted on the design and behavior
        or RAJE. The systematic use of these structural patterns is an added value in all stages of the documents' life-cycle:
        they can be guidelines for creating well-engineered documents and vocabularies, as well as helpers to manipulate
        structural components in documents.

      <p>RASH is accompanied by its <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash">Framework</a>, which is a set of specifications
        and writing/conversion/extraction tools for writing articles in RASH. In particular the RASH Framework includes tools
        for checking the validity of RASH documents, visualising RASH documents on browsers with different layouts, for converting
        RASH documents into LaTeX and ODT/DOCX files into RASH, and for automatically annotate RASH elements with their actual

    <h1>The RASH JavaScript Editor</h1>
    <p>This section presents the main features of RAJE and some details about its implementation. It is split into three parts:
      we first present the basic functionalties, then we go deeper in the support for collaborative editing available in
      RAJE and finally, we provide some implementation details.</p>
    <section id="section10">
      <h1>Editing articles in RAJE</h1>
      <p>RAJE is a stand-alone multi-platform software used to generate RASH documents. Its <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/tree/master/sources/raje">sources</a>        and the related <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/tree/master/tools/RAJE">binary files</a> are available
        on GitHub a licensed according to the <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/blob/master/LICENSE">ISC License</a>,
        as all the other tools included in the RASH Framework. Before starting the development of the tools we have decided
        a series of desiderata and needs that such an editor should properly address, as introduced in the following list:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>being totally compatible with RASH and HTML5; </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>relying on the existing tools developed for visualising RASH documents, included in the RASH Framework;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>simplifying the writing of the document keeping things as natural as possible;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>not enabling the user to personalise the actual rendering of the document according to specific layouts – the focus
            must be on the content only;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>following the best practices already used in existing word processors such as Microsoft Word and Open Office for
            creating structures typical of scholarly articles (lists, tables, figures, references, etc.);</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>allowing the creation of mathematical formulas by means of an appropriate interface, hiding the complexities of
            the language used for storing such formulas with Web-first formats, e.g. MathML;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>interacting with GitHub for easing the storing, sharing, and preservation of the articles.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the following subsections, we provide a brief discussion about how the typical structures of a scholarly article
        can be created by means of RAJE.</p>
      <section id="section14">
        <h1>Article metadata</h1>
        <p>The metadata of a RASH document are stored inside the <code>​head</code>​ element by using <code>meta</code>​ or
          <code>​link</code>​ elements. These metadata are rendered by the browser as shown in <a href="#figure_1"> </a> and
          include the title (mandatory), the author list (mandatory), the ACM subject categories (optional), and the keywords
          (optional). RAJE permits to act on any of these metadata.</p>
        <figure id="figure_1">
          <p><img src="img/header.png" alt="img/header.png" /></p>
          <figcaption>Header of a rendered RASH document as shown in RAJE.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Every element in this metadata section can be easily edited by clicking on it – and the cursor will be placed where
          requested. The title is usually accompanied with a subtitle. To insert the subtitle, one can simply press ​<code>enter</code>​
          at the end of the title. Once added, the subtitle can be filled up with text, and the author can proceed to the
          next editable element pressing <code>enter</code> again.​​</p>
        <p>Any author listed has its own button set for adding a new author after it or for removing the selected one. It is
          possible to specify more affiliations for the same author by pressing the <code>​enter</code>​ key once the cursor
          is placed in the affiliation area, just after the author's name. This action will add a new placeholder that can
          be edited by typing new text or removed by pressing <code>enter</code> again as shown in <a href="#figure_2"> </a>.</p>
        <figure id="figure_2">
          <p><img src="img/author.png" alt="img/author.png" /></p>
          <figcaption>​Adding a new affiliation in RAJE.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><em>Categories</em> and <em>keywords</em> can be also edited by clicking on the specific sections, and pressing the <code>enter</code> key
          allows one to add additional keywords/categories.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="section15">
        <h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>
        <p>From the version 0.6, RASH has started to support the use of different languages for writing mathematical expressions,
          which include MathML, LaTeX and <a href="http://asciimath.org/">AsciiMath</a>. All these formulas are actually
          rendered by means of the <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax processor</a>, while they will be stored in
          MathML in the final RASH source. This flexibility of using several formats allowed us to create an intuitive and
          easy-to-use environment in RAJE in which users write down formulas using only AsciiMath as input – since, from
          preliminary tests we run, AsciiMath seemed to be the language easier to learn, write and remember <a href="#bib26"> </a>.</p>
        <p>However, even if AsciiMath is the easier language for mathematical formulas that can be adopted in the contest of
          RASH documents, it could be difficult anyway to remember all the kinds of operation it allows one to specify. In
          order to address this issue, RAJE also includes several buttons (labelled <q>Operations</q>, <q>Misc</q>, <q>Relations</q>, <q>Symbols</q>,
          and <q>Formulas</q>, as shown in <a href="#figure_3"></a>) that allow one to select an operation among a list of
          instructions. The way all these buttons are presented to the user has been guided by considering the OpenOffice
          formula editor.</p>
        <figure id="figure_3">
          <p><img src="img/formulaeditor.png" alt="The formula editor in RAJE." /></p>
          <figcaption>The formula editor in RAJE.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="section16">
      <h1>Collaborative editing in RAJE</h1>
      <p>Since we wanted to have a system that allows anyone to store and share the article on the Web, we implemented a module
        that allows authors to push the article on a GitHub repository by means of the GiyHub API. GitHub is a web-based
        version control repository that offers all of the distributed version control and source code management features
        of Git, and enables access control and several collaboration facilities (e.g. bug tracking, feature requests, task
        management). In this context, any article created by RAJE can be seen as a repository on GitHub.</p>
      <p>The first time an author pushes the article on GitHub, a new repository is created with all the code (i.e. the main
        text content in HTML) and assets (CSSs, JavaScript files, etc.) needed for guaranteeing a correct visualisation of
        the article. The repository URL is created according to the schema <code>https://github.com/{author_username}/{repository_name}​</code>​,
        where <code>{author_username}</code> is replaced with the author's GitHub username, while the <code>{repository_name}</code> is
        the title of the article.</p>
      <p>During the editing phase, if a user wants to store online the content of a document, he must be first logged in with
        its own Github account, which certifies its identity. Then the user has the option to save the document online, on
        Github servers. This action can be executed in two ways: the shortcut <code>ctrl+shift+s</code> (<code>cmd+shift+s</code> if
        OSX) or the button "push" under the dropdown with author's Github profile avatar on the top-right of the RAJE interface.
        A success message is shown once the commit finished successfully.</p>

      <h1>Technical overview</h1>
      <p>In this section, we introduce some details about the technical implementation of RAJE and the libraries we have reused
        for this purpose.</p>
      <section id="section20">
        <h1>XML-based architecture management</h1>
        <p>The whole set of allowed elements in RASH are added using the contenteditable attribute. When the document is loaded
          and after RASH rendering process, all sections are moved inside a new wrapper with the attribute contenteditable
          set to true. The contenteditable way grants a lot of useful commands (implemented by browsers in different ways)
          such as <b>undo</b>, <b>redo</b> and <b>insertHtml</b>. The insertHtml command is called with the execCommand function,
          passing as parameter the HTML string to be attached where the caret is set.</p>
        <p>Everything is modified (text and structure) in the wrapper created at run time with contenteditable, is treated as
          a single undo level. Unfortunately, this will happens only using these commands, e.g. modifications using vanilla
          JavaScript or JQuery libraries are not undo levels. Browsers and in particular Chromium have not implemented yet
          some kind of APIs to access and modify the local undo buffer. In order to grant a better undo mechanism, it must
          be implemented from scratch again or using a helper external library.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="section18">
        <h1>Electron and other APIs</h1>
        <p>RAJE is based on <a href="https://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>, which allows developers to generate multi-platform
          software using only web-based technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Electron is an Open Source framework created
          by Github developers, based on <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>. Practically speaking, Electron is a browser
          wrapper, since it uses Chromium to create multi-platform softwares. RAJE uses the File System APIs in Electron
          so as to execute create/read/update/delete (CRUD) operations on files. When an author wants to generate a new article,
          RAJE creates its directory and move inside the whole required assets bundle (which are CSS stylesheets and JavaScript
          scripts) using the functions defined in this API. </p>
        <p>The communications between RAJE and GitHub via its APIs is implemented using a specific wrapper: <a href="https://github.com/pksunkara/octonode">Octonode</a>.
          Octonode is built on the Github API v3, and it grants a lot of actions on contents, users, and repositories available
          in GitHub. The Octonode library makes available different methods to authenticate with Github. RAJE has a mechanism
          for directly connecting to a GitHub account by authorising it to access its personal information, as shown in
          <a
            href="#figure_4"> </a>. This window will describe what kind of permissions RAJE needs: it can read all public information about the
            user (such as email, name, biography and so on) and about public repositories.</p>
        <figure id="figure_4">
          <p><img src="img/authorize.png" alt="img/authorize.png" /></p>
          <figcaption>The modal for autorising RAJE to access to user's GitHub information.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Once the authorisation is given, an access token is generated and used for the following requests to/from the GitHub
          repository. When the token is stored, all future requests (such as create a repository or push a commit) are instantly
          served because everything is saved inside a local variable of the user. When a new article is opened, a local folder
          is created with the document and all the needed assets. When authors want to push changes to a repository that
          does not exist yet, it is created automatically. </p>
      </section>
      <section id="section19">
        <h1>Core scripts</h1>
        <p>The splash window shown after opening RAJE is just an HTML file with its own JavaScript and CSS, which allows one
          to create a new document or to open an existing one. Once created/opened, the editor shows a skeleton of a RASH
          document (i.e. an HTML page) shown in <a href="#figure_9"></a>, which is visualised according to the <em>rash.js</em>          script. In addition, this HTML page also includes the <em>raje.js</em> script, for enabling users to edit the document
          by means of a toolbar and other useful elements.</p>
        <figure id="figure_9">
          <p><img src="img/skeleton.png" alt="img/skeleton.png" /></p>
          <figcaption>​The skeleton presented by RAJE after the creation of a new article.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Thus, <em>raje.js</em> implements the <em>editor behaviour</em> of RAJE and it is explicitly included in the HTML
          document produced by it. However, open the HTML document with a common browser will result in viewing it by means
          of the visualisation facilities made available by the RASH Framework as implemented in <em>rash.js</em>. All the
          RAJE project flow is totally based on the <em>raje.js</em> script, that has been developed by concatenating the
          following eight scripts (each with its own behaviour and purpose):</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>init.js;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>caret.js;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>const.js;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>core.js;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>shortcuts.js;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>toolbar.js;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>derash.js;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>rendered.js.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>Init.js</em> is the initialization script, which initialises all the variables, it extends JQuery object adding
          additional functions, and it calls the <code>$(document).ready()</code> function to show the whole editor. </p>
        <p>The second script, <em>caret.js</em>, provides some utility methods about the caret and its position within the content.
          It contains functions to check if the caret is inside an element, and to create a selection that wraps entirely
          the node where the caret is. All the methods here are based on <a href="https://github.com/timdown/rangy">Rangy</a>,
          a cross-browser JavaScript range, and selection library. </p>
        <p>The file <em>const.js</em> defines constant values that are used by the other scripts.</p>
        <p>The fourth script, i.e. <em>raje.js</em>, implements a set of actions to add elements into the body (sections, cross
          references, inlines, etc.). These actions can use the browser content-editable APIs (e.g. to add undo/redo functionalities)
          or the method <code>document.execCommand('insertHTML')​</code> for adding an HTML string to the caret. </p>
        <p>All shortcuts used in the editor are defined in the shortcuts.js script. All of them are bound inside an init function
          called when the document is ready. The shortcuts are all implemented using <a href="https://craig.is/killing/mice">Mousetrap</a>,
          a simple library for handling keyboard shortcuts in JavaScript.</p>
        <p>The entire graphic elements set is defined in the<strong> </strong><em>toolbar.js</em> script. In particular, it
          adds the toolbar and all the modal windows used in RAJE (e.g. for creating formulas).</p>
        <p>The document rendered in RAJE (or in any browser) is slightly different from the actual sources since <em>rash.js</em> applies
          some transformations so as to guarantee a correct visualisation of all the metadata and the content of the article
          in consideration. Thus, in order to recreate correctly the structure of the sources that must be stored, we have
          implemented the <em>derash.js</em> script. This script is used when a user asks to save the article, and it allows
          the creation of a well-indented HTML code compliant with RASH that will be stored in the file system.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, the <em>rendered.js</em> script contains everything to handle communication from the document
          to other services, such as GitHub and the Electron File System APIs.</p>

    <h1>Evaluation</h1>
    <p>In order to estimate the perceived usability of RAJE for writing scholarly articles, we have involved some people from
      the academic domain in a user testing session. All the material and the outcomes of the test is available at <a href="#bib22"> </a>.
      The test has been organised as a Discount Usability Test, which is a specific kind of test that involves a small group
      of people. Past studies <a href="#bib5"></a> <a href="#bib4"></a> have demonstrated that it is possible to find up
      to 80% of the main bugs involving only 5 people. In this section, we present the setting and the outcome of the evaluation
      we performed.</p>
    <section id="section7">
      <h1>Settings</h1>
      <p>We asked 6 subjects to perform two unsupervised tasks. There were no administrators observing the subjects while they
        were undertaking these tasks. All the subjects were volunteers who responded to personal emails. In the first task,
        we asked the participants to reproduce the content of a <a href="http://gianmarco.spinaci.web.cs.unibo.it/raje/test.pdf">PDF of a scholarly article</a>        using RAJE. In the second task, we asked to the participants to push the article to GitHub by using the functionalities
        implemented in RAJE and to write down the URL of the repository created.</p>
      <p>The test session was structured as follows. We first asked subjects to complete a short multiple-choice questionnaire
        about their background knowledge and skills in writing scholarly articles. In particular, we asked them to answer
        to seventeen assertions according to a five-point scale (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree).
        These assertions were organised according to four different categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Knowledge about document formats (DOC(X), ODT, etc.); </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Experience in using word processors and HTML-based editors; </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Expertise in writing scholarly articles;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Adoption of control version systems.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then, we asked participants to complete the aforementioned two tasks using RAJE <strong>without having any prior knowledge</strong>        about the tool. Finally, we asked the participants to fill in two short questionnaires, one multiple choice, i.e.
        a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire <a href="#bib23"></a>, and the other textual, to report their experience
        of using RAJE to complete these tasks. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="section8">
      <h1>Outcomes</h1>
      <p>All the six people involved (from Canada, Sweden, Germany, Italy, and England) has answered positively to our invitation.
        In particular, we received 6 full feedbacks about the usage of the current version of RAJE.</p>
      <p>The usability score for RAJE was computed using the System Usability Scale (SUS)
        <a href="#bib23"></a>, a well-known questionnaire used for the perception of the usability of a system. It has the
        advantage of being technology independent (it has been tested on hardware, software, Web sites, etc.) and it is reliable
        even with a very small sample size. In addition to the main SUS scale, we also were interested in examining the sub-scales
        of pure Usability and pure Learnability of the system, as proposed recently by Lewis and Sauro <a href="#bib24"></a>.
        In the analysis of the SUS scores, we have noticed that one of the participants was a clear outlier since he experienced
        a misconfiguration of the system that prevented him from using RAJE correctly. Thus, for the SUS analysis, we decided
        not to consider the answers he provided, that were radically different from the other five participants indeed.</p>
      <p>The mean SUS score for RAJE was 69 (in a 0 to 100 range), slightly surpassing the target score of 68 to demonstrate
        a good level of usability <a href="#bib23"></a>. The mean values for the SUS sub-scales Usability and Learnability
        were 65.6 and 82.5 respectively. In addition, four sub-scores were calculated for each participant by considering
        the values of the answers given in the background questionnaire, according to the four categories introduced in the
        previous section (knowledge on document formats, experience in using word processors, expertise in writing articles,
        and adoption of control version systems). We compared these sub-scores with the SUS values and the other sub-scales
        using the Pearson’s r, obtaining the results illustrated in <a href="#figure_10"></a> (where the dashed line is a
        linear regression). </p>
      <figure id="figure_10">
        <p><img src="img/scores.png" alt="img/scores.png" /></p>
        <figcaption>​The comparisons between the SUS scores (and subscales) and all the four background scores.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>We found a small negative correlation between all the experience sub-scores and the Learnability score, which seems
        to highlight that the more background knowledge one has the more the system is difficult to learn. Similarly, the
        expertise in writing articles seems to be negatively correlated with any SUS score obtained. However, each correlation
        measure appears to be not statistically significant and we would need to enrich our dataset to come to a more precise
        conclusion.​​​</p>

    <p>Axial coding <a href="#bib25"></a> of the personal comments expressed in the final questionnaires by all the six participants
      revealed a some widely perceived issues, as shown in <a href="#table_1"> </a>. The most affected category concerns
      the functionalities made available by RAJE. In fact, some bugs were faced by testers, and in some cases those bugs
      denied the normal flow of tool. Basic keyboard shortcuts such as <code>ctrl+a</code> to select the entire content of
      a single metadata or the <code>tab</code> key to navigate from a table cell to the next one was not implemented yet,
      and they have been perceived as important flows. The insertion of elements have shown some issues that prevented the
      participants to add some structures (such as tables, figures and formulas) were requested. Another important issue
      highlighted was the lack of a form for adding structured bibliographic references, e.g. by using the fields proper
      to BibTeX. On the other hand, the category about the interface provided by RAJE has been evaluated rather positively.
      In particular, the interface has been considered intuitive and minimal, and the toolbar icons have been easy to understand
      thanks to their familiarity with the existing word processors. Finally, all the participants praised the efficiency
      of the tool, since it allowed them to address the writing task very quickly.</p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>In this paper we introduce the RASH JavaScript Editor (RAJE), a WYSIWYG word processor for writing scholarly articles
      in HTML by means of the RASH format. In particular RAJE allows authors to write research papers in HTML natively by
      means of a user-friendly interface, instead of writing raw markup with a IDE, text editors or external word processors.
      RAJE has been developed for enabling the use of an alternative format, i.e. HTML, to PDF, which has important drawbacks
      such as the lack of interactivity, the fact that its monolithic structure is not appropriate for sharing its content
      on the Web as a common webpage, and its known difficulties regarding the accessibility of its content by people with
      disabilities. RAJE has been used during an user testing session that involved six participants so as to understand
      its perceived usability. The outcomes of this evaluation are encouraging, and they also provided us with important
      feedback for improving the tool.</p>
    <p>In the future, we plan to fix existing bugs and issues highlighted by the evaluation, as well as we plan to add new features
      to RAJE. In particular, one of these features would be to enable the use of annotations on the document by means of
      <a href="https://hypothes.is/">hypothes.is</a>. In addition, the implementation of mechanisms for allowing a better
      navigation of the document, e.g. via a table of content, could be quite useful for long texts, and we are currently
      experimenting on some approaches to add to the current version of RAJE for addressing this aspect.</p>
