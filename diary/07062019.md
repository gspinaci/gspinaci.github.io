## Meeting report 
During the today's meeting my supervisor and I defined three main steps to do in the next week:
1. Create a Google Form for getting the list of DH journals. The form will be submitted to Domain experts, starting from Italian at the beginning and then It will be sent at the DH conf in Utrecth.
2. Complete the internship project taking into acount Dimension.
3. Run the Leiden algorithm over COCI

### Create the authority list of DH journals
In the same way I did during for the internship project, I must find a way to create a list of DH journals. While there are some unstructured indexes (eg. [list of dh journals, Berkley](https://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/resources/digital-humanities-journals)), for our aims we need to create a structured list with some important metadata such us [ERIH PLUS](https://dbh.nsd.uib.no/publiseringskanaler/erihplus/periodical/listApproved).
