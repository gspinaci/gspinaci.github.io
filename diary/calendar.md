## Deadlines

### July

**July 31th:** Get the cluster of Dimension, fixing the issues faced when I was in Leiden.

In the meantime, I will ask Silvio the access to the COCI dataset for starting the data manipulation and transform it into a 0-index list of edges, required by the Leiden Algorithm.

### August

**August 9th:** Last useful day for having the list of DH journal completed. Validate if the alredy created clusters are coherent (time eg. only publications from 2000 and typologies eg. only articles, no book chapter).

**August 10th:** Spatial and temporal coverage analysis of journals and DBs. How many DH journals are indexed, for how many years the DH journals have been indexed?

**August 18th-25th:** I will have all the plots ready for the analysis phase. This means that within this timespan, I will have all the percentage of DH publications for each cluster. 
Also with the three different visualisation based on the perception level asked in the form.

### September

Analyse results

### October

Write dissertation
